# JavaScript DOM Selectors
 
### DOM selectors

Selectors allow you to grab a piece or pieces of markup from the html page your working with. In Javascript we refer to elements or tags as nodes. So were slecting a node or group of nodes from the DOM using the following Javascript methods.

+ getElementsByTagName()
+ getElementsByClassName()
+ getElementById()
+ querySelector()
+ querySelectorAll()

In CPSC1520 your more than likely to gravitate to using querySelector(). However you need to be aware of all of the DOM level selector becaues there are times when each one of them is more apropriate for certain coding solutions.
