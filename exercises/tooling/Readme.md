# CPSC1520 What You Need To Start Coding
All you need to start developing JavaScript is a code editor, a browser and a great idea. I often say that choosing a code editor is a very flippant decision for most developers. If you become bitten by the JavaScript bug you will probably spend more time with your code editor than your friends and family. So you better choose wisely. Your editor should be a comfortable space that allows you to perform tasks effectively and efficiently.	


## Popular Editors   
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
This is the code editor I use and is the choice of most front end and full stack developers. It has a great set of extensions for HTML CSS and JavaScript. 

- [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)  
Before I moved to VSCode this was my editor of choice. Haven't used it in many years so I can't really say what new what improved. Developers still use it  so take it for a test drive. 

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)  
I really wanted Atom to crush the editor space but not so I really like the interface and how the JavaScript workflow was managed. My love for Atom lives on in VSCode with the help of the Atom Material Theme. 

- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)  
Never really was into this editor though I tried it for developing HTML and CSS. That's about it though it wasn’t set up at that time to be a full featured javascript coding environment. Worth taking a look at though.  

- [Emacs ](http://brackets.io/),  [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php), [NotePadd ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
These editors are the purest of the pure code editors. There is not extensions support they are just code editors with no thrills that allow you to write code. Personally not my cup of tea but worth learning how to use Emacs or Vim as you will need them later in your carreer when working with the command line.

I have included a link to a google search for javascript code editors there are so many choices I would suggest that you check them out and see what fits for you.
